# final_project_utcc
This is my Final Year Project 

## Requirements
This project consists of three Bangkok tourism-related applications based on user groups: 1. Tourists 2. Tour guides 3. Admin of Global Guide (Travel agents).

All requirements are from Global Guide:
* Tourists can register and log in to book Tour guide. They can set the date and time, choose a method of travel and choose attractions and they can paid through google pay. They can also check being the reservation and cancel the reservation with a refund according to the specified time conditions. Including making menus and sections that may be added in the future
* Tour guides can register and log in to get jobs, check jobs and change job status. Including managing the schedule they want to work. If there is an incident that makes it impossible to go to work that has been accepted they can be able to find a replacement in 2 ways: by selecting in the application and allowing people outside the application. KPIs are calculated and displayed to measure performance. They can check the balance from work, including being able to withdraw money through a Thai bank account by sending a request to the admin
* Admin of Global Guide can log in to manage tourist refunds, transfer money from tour guide requests. And manage to ban accounts of tour guides whose KPI values are below the conditions.
